          Your involvement in this project is not just about contributionâ€”it's about becoming a medium for Hanuman Ji's
          infinite blessings. Every act of support, be it a kind word, a shared idea, or a financial contribution,
          carries his divine touch.

          <p className="mb-4">
            We humbly ask that if you feel your resources may not align with dharma or have been earned outside the
            principles of goodness and righteousness, you refrain from contributing. This request is not personal but a
            sacred reminder that Hanuman Ji's blessings are already boundless.
          </p>
          <p>Your intentions and faith are what matter most in this journey.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Let us unite to bring this divine dream to reality. Share this vision with others who feel inspired to be part
          of this eternal blessing, and together, let's create a sanctuary that stands as a testament to faith, hope,
          and love for generations to come.
